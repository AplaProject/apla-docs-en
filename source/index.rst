.. ifconfig:: if_project in ('genesis')
   
   By the end of 2017 it became obvious that the platform was ready to compete head-on with existing public blockchain networks, including Ethereum, NEO, etc. All of the previous hard work and success has given rise to a new project based on the platform. Its name is **Genesis**. The team is planning to launch this project without any issue of tokens.

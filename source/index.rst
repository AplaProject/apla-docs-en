About this documentation
------------------------

This documentation contains the description of |platform|, a public blockchain platform for building digital ecosystems.

This documentation includes the up-to-date descriptions of the platform's function and is constantly updated whenever changes are made or new functions are added.


History of DayLight, eGaaS, Apla, and Genesis
---------------------------------------------

|platform| is based on the source code of the blockchain created for the DCoin cryptocurrency, written in 2011 by the DCoin project founder.


DayLight
^^^^^^^^

Work put into creating the current version of the platform started early in 2016 as a part of the **DayLight** project. 

Through the dedicated work of a number of programmers, the following tasks were accomplished by autumn 2016: main network protocols and the light software client were created, the concept of smart contracts was developed and early versions of interface and contract programming languages were released. 


eGaaS
^^^^^

Since the platform was initially developed for the implementation of projects in the area of e-Government, the team decided to change the project name to **eGaaS** (*Electronic Government as a Service*). 

Early in spring 2017 the testnet was launched, and by autumn 2017 a number of proof-of-concept projects were developed for UAE, India, and Luxembourg (business registration, contract management, land registry, supply chain management, vehicle registration, etc.).


Apla
^^^^

In the summer of 2017 the team decided to move towards creating a public blockchain network based on the existing platform, integrating user accounts registration in accordance with the KYC procedure (this work was conducted simultaneously with development of pilot e-Government projects). The new project was given a name — **Apla**, which means "simply" in Greek. 

Names were also given to the platform's software client — *Molis*, and programming languages: *Simvolio* for the contract language and *Protypo* for the interface language. 

At the same time, the procedure of source code refactoring was launched: the code of the software client was completely re-written (based on the JavaScript React library), the new version of REST API v2 was created, and both *Simvolio* and *Protypo* languages were significantly improved. Additionally, the concept and functions of dedicated ecosystems were developed and implemented, work on the development of the visual page designer was started, and some other changes and improvements were implemented.


Genesis
^^^^^^^

By the end of 2017 it became obvious that the platform was ready to compete head-on with existing public blockchain networks, including Ethereum, NEO, etc. All of the previous hard work and success has given rise to a new project based on the platform. Its name is **Genesis**. The team is planning to launch this project without the use of a typical ICO. Instead, we're distributing tokens directly to programmers, namely GitHub users.

A smart contract (hereinafter, "contract") is a basic element of applications, which performs a single action (typically, makes a record in a database table), initiated from the user interface by a user or by another contract. All operations with data in applications are formed as a system of contracts, interacting with each other through database tables or by call functions in a contract body.

Contracts are written using an original (developed by the team of platform developers) Turing-complete script language called Simvolio, with compilation into bytecode. The language includes a set of functions, operators and constructions that can be used for the implementation of data processing algorithms and operations with the database. 

Contracts can be edited, but only if editing was not forbidden by way of putting false in the contract editing rights. Operations with data in the blockchain are performed by the most up-to-date (current) version of the contract. The complete history of changes made to contracts is stored in the blockchain and available from the software client.

Structure of the contract
=========================

Contracts are declared with the contract keyword, followed by the new contract's name. The contract's body should be enclosed in curly brackets. Every contract consists of three sections:

#. **data** - declares the input data (names and types of variables),
#. **conditions** - verifies the correctness of input data,
#. **action** - includes the actions performed by the contract.

.. code:: js

  contract MyContract {
      data {
          FromId address
          ToId   address
          Amount money
      }
      func conditions {
          ...
      }
      func action {
      }
  }
  

Data section
------------

The contract input data, as well as the parameters of the form for the reception of the data are described in the **data** section. 
The data are listed line by line: first, the variable name is specified (only variables, but not arrays are transferred), then the type and the parameters for the building of the interface form are indicated optionally through a gap in double quotation marks:

* *hidden* - hidden element of the form,
* *optional* - form element without obligatory filling in,
* *date* - field of the date and time selection,
* *polymap* - map with the selection of coordinates and areas,
* *map* - map with the ability to mark the place,
* *image* - images upload,
* *text* - entry of the text of HTML-code in the textarea field,
* *crypt:Field* - create and encrypt a private key for the destination specified in the *Field* field. If only ``crypt`` is specified, then the private key will be created for the user who signs the contract,
* *address* - field for input of the account address,
* *signature:contractname* - a line to display the contractname contract, which requires the signatures (it is discussed in detail in a special description section).

.. code:: js

  contract my {
    data {
        Name string 
        RequestId address
        Photo bytes "image optional"
        Amount money
        Private bytes "crypt:RequestId"
    }
    ...
  }

    
Conditions section
------------------

Validation of the data obtained is performed in the Conditions section. The following commands are used to warn of the presence of errors: ``error``, ``warning``, ``info``. In fact, all three of them generate an error that stops the contract operation, but each of them displays a different message in the interface: *critical error*, *warning*, and *informative error*. For instance, 


.. code:: js

  if fuel == 0 {
        error "fuel cannot be zero!"
  }
  if money < limit {
        warning Sprintf("You don't have enough money: %v < %v", money, limit)
  }
  if idexist > 0 {
        info "You have already been registered"
  }

  
Action section
--------------

The action section contains the contract's main program code that retrieves additional data and records the resulting values to database tables. For example,

.. code:: js

	action {
		DBUpdate("keys", $key_id,"-amount", $amount)
		DBUpdate("keys", $recipient,"+amount,pub", $amount, $Pub)
	}


.. _simvolio-predefined-variables:

Variables in the contract
-------------------------

Contract input data, declared in the data section, is passed to other sections though variables with the ``$`` sign followed by data names. The ``$`` sign can be used to declare additional variables; such variables will be considered global for this contract and all nested contracts.

A contract can access predefined variables that contain data about the transaction, from which this contract was called.

* ``$time`` – transaction time, int,
* ``$ecosystem_id`` – ecosystem ID, int,
* ``$block`` – number of the block, in which this transaction is included, int,
* ``$key_id`` – ID of the account that signed the transaction; the value will be zero for VDE contracts,
* ``$wallet_block`` – address of the node that formed the block, in which this transaction is included,
* ``$block_time`` – time, when the block with the transaction containing the current contract was formed.
* ``$original_contract`` - name of the contract, which was initially called for transaction processing. If this variable is an empty string, it means that the contract was called in the process of verification of a condition. To check whether this contract was called by another contract or directly from a transaction, the values of **$original_contract** and **$this_contract** are to be compared. If they are equal, it means that the contract was called from the transaction.
* ``$this_contract`` - name of the currently executed contract.  

Predefined variables are accessible not only in contracts, but also in Permissions fields, (where conditions for access to application elements are defined), where they are used in construction of logical expressions. When used in Permissions fields, variables related to block formation (``$time``, ``$block``, etc.) always equal zero.

Predefined variable $result is used to return a value from a nested contract.

.. code:: js

  contract my {
    data {
        Name string 
        Amount money
    }
    func conditions {
        if $Amount <= 0 {
           error "Amount cannot be 0"
        }
        $ownerId = 1232
    }
    func action {
        DBUpdate("mytable", $ownerId, "name,amount", $Name, $Amount - 10 )
        DBUpdate("mytable2", $citizen, "amount", 10 )
    }
  }
  
Nested Contracts
================

A nested contract can be called from the conditions and action sections of the enclosing contract. A nested contract can be called directly with parameters specified in parenthesis after its name (NameContract(Params)), or using the CallContract function, for which the contract name is passed using a string variable.


Contracts with signature
========================

Since the language of contracts writing allows performing enclosed contracts, it is possible to fulfill such an enclosed contract without the knowledge of the user who has run the external contract that may lead to the user's signature of transactions unauthorized by it, let's say the transfer of money from its account.

Let's suppose there is a TokenTransfer Contract *TokenTransfer*:

.. code:: js

    contract TokenTransfer {
        data {
          Recipient int
          Amount    money
        }
        ...
    }

If in a contract launched by the user the string ``TokenTransfer("Recipient,Amount", 12345, 100)`` is inscribed, 100 coins will be transferred to the account 12345. In such a case the user who signs an external contract will remain unaware of the transaction. This situation may be excluded if the TokenTransfer contract requires the additional user's signature upon its calling in of contracts. To do this:

1. Adding a field with the name **Signature** with the ``optional`` and ``hidden`` parameters in the *data* section of the *TokenTransfer* contract, which allow not to require the additional signature in the direct calling of the contract, since there will be the signature in the **Signature** field so far.

.. code:: js

    contract TokenTransfer {
        data {
          Recipient int
          Amount    money
          Signature string "optional hidden"
        }
        ...
    }

2. Adding in the *Signatures* table (on the page *Signatures* of platform client) the entry containing:

*	*TokenTransfer* contract name,
*	field names whose values will be displayed to the user, and their text description,
*	text to be displayed upon confirmation.
  
In the current example it will be enough specifying two fields **Recipient** and **Amount**:

* **Title**: Are you agree to send money this recipient?
* **Parameter**: Recipient Text: Account ID
* **Parameter**: Amount Text: Amount (qEGS)

Now, if inserting the ``TokenTransfer(“Recipient, Amount”, 12345, 100)`` contract calling in, the system error ``“Signature is not defined”`` will be displayed. If the contract is called in as follow: ``TokenTransfer("Recipient, Amount, Signature", 12345, 100, "xxx...xxxxx")``, the system error will occur upon signature verification. Upon the contract calling in, the following information is verified: *time of the initial transaction, user ID, the value of the fields specified in the signatures table*, and it is impossible to forge the signature.

In order for the user to see the money transfer confirmation upon the *TokenTransfer* contract calling in, it is necessary to add a field with an arbitrary name and the type ``string``, and with the optional parameter ``signature:contractname``. Upon calling in of the enclosed *TokenTransfer* contract, you just need to forward this parameter. It should also be borne in mind that the parameters for the secured contract calling in must also be described in the ``data`` section of the external contract (they may be hidden, but they will still be displayed upon confirmation). For instance,

.. code:: js

    contract MyTest {
      data {
          Recipient int "hidden"
          Amount  money
          Signature string "signature:TokenTransfer"
      }
      func action {
          TokenTransfer("Recipient,Amount,Signature",$Recipient,$Amount,$Signature)
      }
    }

When sending a *MyTest* contract, the additional confirmation of the money transfer to the indicated account will be requested from user. If other values, such as ``TokenTransfer(“Recipient,Amount,Signature”,$Recipient, $Amount+10, $Signature)``, are listed in the enclosed contract, the invalid signature error will occur.


File Upload
===========

To upload files from ``multipart/form-data`` forms, the contract fields with type ``bytes`` and tag ``file`` should be used. Example:

.. code:: js

    contract Upload {
        data {
            File bytes "file"
        }
        ...
    }
 
For work with mime-type files, an additional parameter ``{Field}MimeType`` will be passed to the contract . Example:
 
.. code:: js

    contract Upload {
        data {
            File bytes "file"
        }
        action {
            Println($FileMimeType)
        }
    }

The `UploadBinary` system contract is intended to upload and store files.
To request a download link for a file from the template designer, there is a special template designer function – `Binary`.

Contract Editor
===============

Contracts can be created and edited in a special editor which is a part of the Molis software client. Each new contract has a typical structure created in it by default with three sections: ``data, conditions, action``. The contracts editor helps to:

- Write the contract code (highlighting key words of the Simvolio language,
- Format the contract source code,
- Bind the contract to an account, from which the payment for its execution will be charged, 
- Define permissions to edit the contract (typically, by specifying the contract name with the permissions stipulated in a special function ContractConditions or by way of direct indication of access conditions in the Change conditions field),
- View the history of changes made to the contract with the option to restore previous versions.


Simvolio Contracts Language
===========================

Contracts in the platform are written using an original (developed by the platform team) Turing-complete script language called Simvolio, with compilation into bytecode. The language includes a set of functions, operators and constructions that can be used for implementation of data processing algorithms and operations with the database. The Simvolio language provides for:

- Declaration of variables with different data types, as well as simple and associative arrays: var, array, map,
- Use of the ``if`` conditional statement and the ``while`` loop structure,
- Retrieval of values from the database and recording data to database ``DBFind, DBInsert, DBUpdate``,
- Work with contracts,
- Conversion of variables,
- Operations with strings.


Basic elements and constructions of the language
------------------------------------------------

Data Types and Variables
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Data type should be defined for every variable. In obvious cases, data types are converted automatically. The following data types can be used:

* ``bool`` - Boolean, can be true or false,
* ``bytes`` - a sequence of bytes,
* ``int`` - a 64-bit integer,
* ``address`` - a 64-bit unsigned integer,
* ``array`` - an array of values of arbitrary types,
* ``map`` - an associative array of values of arbitrary data types with string keys,
* ``money`` - an integer of the big integer type; values are stored in the database without decimal points, which are added when displaying values in the user interface in accordance with the currency configuration settings,
* ``float`` - a 64-bit number with a floating point,
* ``string`` - a string; should be defined in double quotes or back quotes: "This is a string" or `This is a string`.

All identifiers, including the names of variables, functions, contracts, etc. are case sensitive (MyFunc and myFunc are different names). 

Variables are declared with the **var** keyword, followed by names and types of variables. Variables declared inside curly brackets should be used within the same pair of curly brackets. When declared, variables have default values: for *bool* type it is *false*, for all numeric types – zero values, for strings – empty strings. Examples of variables declaration: 

.. code:: js

  func myfunc( val int) int {
      var mystr1 mystr2 string, mypar int
      var checked bool
      ...
      if checked {
           var temp int
           ...
      }
  }


Arrays
""""""

The language supports two array types: 

* ``array`` - a simple array with numeric index starting from zero, 
* ``map`` - an associative array with string keys.

When assigning and и retrieving array elements, index should be put in square brackets.

.. code:: js

    var myarr array
    var mymap map
    var s string
    
    myarr[0] = 100
    myarr[1] = "This is a line"
    mymap["value"] = 777
    mymap["param"] = "Parameter"

    s = Sprintf("%v, %v, %v", myarr[0] + mymap["value"], myarr[1], mymap["param"])
    // s = 877, This is a line, Parameter 


If and While Statements
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The contract language supports the standard **if** conditional statement and the **while** loop, which can be used in functions and contracts. These statements can be nested in each other. 

A keyword should be followed by a conditional statement. If the conditional statement returns a number, then it is considered as *false* when its value = zero. For example, *val == 0* is equivalent to *!val*, and *val != 0* is the same as just *val*. The **if** statement can have an **else** block, which executes in case the **if** conditional statement is false. The following comparison operators can be used in conditional statements: ``<, >, >=, <=, ==, !=``, as well as ``||`` (OR) and ``&&`` (AND).

.. code:: js

    if val > 10 || id != $citizen {
      ...
    } else {
      ...
    }

The **while** statement is intended for implementation of loops. A **while** block will be executed while its condition is true. The **break** operator is used to end a loop inside a block. To start a loop from the beginning, the **continue** operator should be used.

.. code:: js

  while true {
      if i > 100 {
         break
      }
      ...
      if i == 50 {
         continue
      }
      ...
  }

Apart from conditional statements, the language supports standard arithmetic operations: ``+,-,*,/``
Variables of **string** and **bytes** types can be used as a condition. In this case, the condition will be true when the length of the string (bytes) is greater than zero, and false for an empty string.

Functions
"""""""""

Functions of the contracts language perform operations with data received in the data section of a contract: reading and writing database values, converting value types, and establishing connections between contracts.

Functions are declared with the **func** keyword, followed by the function name and a list of parameters passed to it (with their types), all enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas. After the closing curly bracket the data type of the value returned by the function should be stated. The function body should be enclosed in curly brackets. If a function does not have parameters, then the curly brackets are not necessary. To return a value from a function, the ``return`` keyword is used.

.. code:: js

  func myfunc(left int, right int) int {
      return left*right + left - right
  }
  func test int {
      return myfunc(10, 30) + myfunc(20, 50)
  }
  func ooops {
      error "Ooops..."
  }
  
Functions don't return errors, because all error checks are carried out automatically. When an error is generated in any function, the contract stops its operation and displays a window with the error description.

An undefined number of parameters can be passed to a function. To do this, put **...** instead of the type of the last parameter. In this case, the data type of the last parameter will be *array*, and it will contain all, starting from this parameter, variables that were passed with the call. Variables of any type can be passed, but you should take care of possible conflicts related to data type mismatch.

.. code:: js

  func sum(out string, values ...) {
      var i, res int
      
      while i < Len(values) {
         res = res + values[i]
         i = i + 1
      }
      Println(out, res)
  }

  func main() {
     sum("Sum:", 10, 20, 30, 40)
  }
  
Let's consider a situation, where a function has many parameters, but we need only some of them when calling it. In this case, optional parameters can be declared in the following way: ``func myfunc(name string).Param1(param string).Param2(param2 int) {...}``. You can specify only the parameters you need with the call in arbitrary order: ``myfunc("name").Param2(100)``. In the function body you can address these variables as usual. If an extended parameter is not specified with the call, it will have the default value, for example, an empty string for a string and zero for a number. It should be noted, that you can specify several extended parameters and use ``...``: ``func DBFind(table string).Where(request string, params ...)`` and call ``DBFind("mytable").Where("id > ? and type = ?", myid, 2)``

.. code:: js
 
    func DBFind(table string).Columns(columns string).Where(format string, tail ...)
             .Limit(limit int).Offset(offset int) string  {
       ...
    }
     
    func names() string {
       ...
       return DBFind("table").Columns("name").Where("id=?", 100).Limit(1)
    }


Predefined values
"""""""""""""""""

The following variables are available when executing a contract. 

* ``$key_id`` - a numerical identifier (int64) of the account that signed the transaction,
* ``$ecosystem_id`` - identifier of the ecosystem where the transaction was created, 
* ``$type`` identifier of an external contract from where the current contract was called, 
* ``$time`` - time specified in the transaction in Unix format, 
* ``$block`` - block number in which this transaction is sealed, 
* ``$block_time`` - time specified in the block, 
* ``$block_key_id`` - numeric identifier (int64) of the node that signed the block,
* ``$auth_token`` is the authorization token, which can be used in VDE contracts, for example, when calling contracts though API with the ``HTTPRequest`` function.

.. code:: js

	var pars, heads map
	heads["Authorization"] = "Bearer " + $auth_token
	pars["vde"] = "false"
	ret = HTTPRequest("http://localhost:7079/api/v2/node/mycontract", "POST", heads, pars)

It should be kept in mind that these variables are available not only in the functions of the contract but also in other functions and expressions, for example, in conditions that are specified for contracts, pages and other objects. In this case, *$time*, *$block* variables related to the block and others are equal to 0.

The value that needs to be returned from the contract should be assigned to a predefined variable ``$result``.


Retrieving values from the database
-----------------------------------

DBFind(table string) [.Columns(columns string)] [.Where(where string, params ...)] [.WhereId(id int)] [.Order(order string)] [.Limit(limit int)] [.Offset(offset int)] [.Ecosystem(ecosystemid int)] array

The Function receives data from a database table in accordance with the request specified. Returned is an *array* comprised of *map* associative arrays.

* *table* - table name,
* *сolumns* - list of returned columns. If not specified, all columns will be returned, 
* *Where* - search condition. For instance, ``.Where("name = 'John'")`` or ``.Where("name = ?", "John")``,
* *id* - search by identifier. For example, *.WhereId(1)*,
* *order* - a field, which will be used for sorting. By default, values are sorted by *id*,
* *limit* - number of returned values (default = 25, maximum = 250),
* *offset* - returned values offset,
* *ecosystemid* - ecosystem ID. By default, values are taken from the table in the current ecosystem.

.. code:: js

   var i int
   ret = DBFind("contracts").Columns("id,value").Where("id> ? and id < ?", 3, 8).Order("id")
   while i < Len(ret) {

Date/time operations in PostgreSQL queries
------------------------------------------

Functions do not allow direct possibilities to select, update, etc.. but they allow you to use the capabilities and functions of PostgreSQL when you get values and a description of the where conditions  in the samples. This includes, among other things, the functions for working with dates and time. For example, you need to compare the column *date_column* and the current time. If  *date_column* has the  type timestamp, then the expression will be the following ``date_column> now ()``. And if *date_column* stores time in Unix format as a number, then the expression will be ``to_timestamp (date_column)> now ()``.

.. code:: js

    to_timestamp(date_column) > now()
    date_initial < now() - 30 * interval '1 day'
    
Consider the situation when we have a value in Unix format and we need to write it in a field of type *timestamp *. In this case, when listing fields, before the name of this column you need to specify **timestamp**.

.. code:: js

   DBInsert("mytable", "name,timestamp mytime", "John Dow", 146724678424 )

If you have a string value of time and you need to write it in a field with the type *timestamp*, in this case, **timestamp** must be specified before the value itself.

.. code:: js

   DBInsert("mytable", "name,mytime", "John Dow", "timestamp 2017-05-20 00:00:00" )
   var date string
   date = "2017-05-20 00:00:00"
   DBInsert("mytable", "name,mytime", "John Dow", "timestamp " + date )
   DBInsert("mytable", "name,mytime", "John Dow", "timestamp " + $txtime )
